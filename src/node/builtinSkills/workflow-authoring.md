# Workflow Authoring

Use this skill **before writing or editing a workflow definition**. Workflows are durable JavaScript conductors that coordinate sub-agent tasks, validate structured reports, and preserve run state for replay/resume.

## When to use a workflow

Prefer a workflow when the task is a repeatable orchestration pattern, especially when it needs several of these:

- Multiple phases with clear progress reporting (`phase`, `log`).
- Parallel sub-agent fan-out with stable roles or lanes.
- Structured output validation from sub-agents.
- Adversarial verification / cross-checking of candidate findings.
- Durable state so completed work is reused after resume/restart.
- A reusable slash-invokable process, like deep research or deep review.

Do **not** create a workflow for a small one-off edit, a single simple investigation, or work that needs the conductor itself to run shell/filesystem/network operations. The conductor is intentionally limited; delegate those operations to sub-agents.

## Before authoring

1. Run `workflow_list` to see existing workflows.
2. If an existing workflow is close, run `workflow_read({ name })` and adapt the pattern.
3. For one-off drafts, write a scratch workflow:

   ```text
   .mux/workflows/.scratch/<name>.js
   ```

4. Use normal file tools (`file_read`, `file_edit_insert`, `file_edit_replace_string`) to author the JavaScript.
5. Run it by name with `workflow_run`.

Scratch workflows must include a description header and a default exported function:

```js
// description: Short workflow description
export default function workflow({ args, phase, log, agent, parallelAgents, applyPatch }) {
  phase("scope", { input: args.input });
  return { reportMarkdown: "Done" };
}
```

Reusable project workflows live in `.mux/workflows/<name>.js`; global workflows live in `~/.mux/workflows/<name>.js`. Project and scratch workflows require Project Trust.

## Available workflow globals

A workflow default export receives one object:

```js
export default function workflow({ args, phase, log, agent, parallelAgents, applyPatch }) {}
```

### `args`

The invocation payload from `workflow_run`. Plain-text slash args are passed as `{ input: "..." }`, so normalize `args.input` for commands like:

```text
/workflow my-workflow review PR #123
```

### `phase(name, details?)`

Records a durable phase event shown in the run card.

```js
phase("adversarial-verification", { candidateCount: issues.length });
```

### `log(message, data?)`

Records lightweight progress/details.

```js
log("Selected lanes", { lanes });
```

### `agent(spec)`

Runs one workflow-owned sub-agent and waits for its final report.

Required fields:

- `id`: stable step ID used for replay; never derive from unstable ordering unless the input ordering is stable.
- `prompt`: child task prompt.

Optional fields:

- `title`: UI title.
- `agentId`: sub-agent type/id; defaults to the workflow adapter default (usually `explore`).
- `outputSchema`: JSON Schema subset used to validate `structuredOutput`.

Returns:

```ts
{
  taskId: string,
  reportMarkdown: string,
  title?: string,
  structuredOutput?: unknown
}
```

`taskId` is a host-issued patch artifact handle for workflow-owned child tasks. Pass the whole agent result as `applyPatch({ source: result })` instead of inventing task IDs.

### `applyPatch(spec)`

Applies a workflow-owned child task's git patch artifact to the current parent workspace. The host always dry-runs first in a temporary worktree and only performs the real apply when the dry-run succeeds. The conductor never receives raw patch text and cannot apply arbitrary patches.

Required fields:

- `id`: stable replay ID for this mutation step.
- `source` (or `from`): an `agent(...)` result, a `parallelAgents(...)` item, or a workflow-owned `taskId` string.

Optional fields:

- `target`: currently only `"parent"`; this is where the existing task patch artifact is applied.
- `projectPath` / `project_path`: limit a multi-project patch artifact to one project.
- `threeWay` / `three_way`: defaults to `true` and maps to `git am --3way`.
- `force`: allow re-apply / dirty-tree behavior exactly like `task_apply_git_patch`.
- `onConflict`: currently only `"return"`.

Returns structured status instead of throwing on ordinary patch conflicts:

```ts
{
  success: boolean,
  status: "applied" | "conflict" | "failed",
  taskId: string,
  projectResults?: unknown,
  conflictPaths?: string[],
  failedPatchSubject?: string,
  error?: string,
  note?: string
}
```

Conflict resolution should follow the old Orchestrator pattern: spawn a dedicated `exec` resolver, include the failing `taskId`, tell it to call `task_apply_git_patch` in its own workspace, resolve `git am` conflicts, commit the resolved result, report, and then call `applyPatch` on the resolver result.

```js
const implementation = agent({
  id: "implement-auth-fix",
  agentId: "exec",
  prompt: execBrief,
});

let applied = applyPatch({
  id: "apply-auth-fix",
  source: implementation,
  target: "parent",
  onConflict: "return",
});

if (applied.status === "conflict") {
  const resolver = agent({
    id: "resolve-auth-fix-conflict",
    agentId: "exec",
    prompt: buildResolverBrief(applied),
  });
  applied = applyPatch({ id: "apply-resolved-auth-fix", source: resolver });
}
```

### `parallelAgents(specs)`

Runs multiple `agent` specs concurrently and returns results in input order. Use this for review lanes, source summarization, claim verification, or other independent slices.

```js
const laneResults = parallelAgents(
  lanes.map((lane) => ({
    id: `review-${lane}`,
    title: `Review ${lane}`,
    prompt: lanePrompt(lane),
    outputSchema: issueListSchema(),
  }))
);
```

## Structured output schemas

`outputSchema` supports this JSON Schema subset:

- `type`
- `properties`
- `required`
- `items`
- `additionalProperties`
- `enum`

Keep schemas small and strict. Use `additionalProperties: false` for deterministic outputs.

```js
function issueListSchema() {
  return {
    type: "object",
    required: ["issues"],
    additionalProperties: false,
    properties: {
      issues: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          type: "object",
          required: ["title", "severity", "filePaths", "evidence"],
          additionalProperties: false,
          properties: {
            title: { type: "string" },
            severity: { type: "string", enum: ["P0", "P1", "P2", "P3", "P4"] },
            filePaths: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
            evidence: { type: "string" },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  };
}
```

## Replay rules and gotchas

- Every `agent` / `parallelAgents` item and every `applyPatch` call must have a stable `id`.
- The replay key includes the step ID and normalized spec, so changing prompts, schemas, patch source IDs, or apply options creates new work.
- `applyPatch` is a durable mutation effect: completed apply/conflict/failed results are replayed from the journal and are not re-applied on resume.
- The workflow conductor cannot call general tools, import modules, access Node, run shell, read files, use timers, or rely on `Date`/`Math.random`.
- Put shell/filesystem/web investigation inside delegated sub-agent prompts.
- Cap model-produced fan-out before calling `parallelAgents`.
- Return `{ reportMarkdown, structuredOutput }` so the parent agent and UI both get useful output.

## Minimal pattern

```js
// description: Review a change with parallel lanes and verification
export default function workflow({ args, phase, log, agent, parallelAgents }) {
  const target = normalizeTarget(args);

  phase("scope", { target });
  const scope = agent({
    id: "scope",
    title: "Scope work",
    prompt: "Identify review lanes for: " + target,
    outputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      required: ["lanes"],
      additionalProperties: false,
      properties: { lanes: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } } },
    },
  });

  const lanes = scope.structuredOutput.lanes.slice(0, 6);
  log("Running lanes", { lanes });

  phase("lane-review", { lanes });
  const reviews = parallelAgents(
    lanes.map(function (lane) {
      return {
        id: "review-" + lane,
        title: "Review " + lane,
        prompt: "Review " + target + " for " + lane + " issues.",
        outputSchema: issueListSchema(),
      };
    })
  );

  phase("final-synthesis", { reviewCount: reviews.length });
  const final = agent({
    id: "synthesize",
    title: "Synthesize result",
    prompt: "Synthesize these structured review outputs: " + JSON.stringify(reviews),
  });

  return { reportMarkdown: final.reportMarkdown };
}

function normalizeTarget(args) {
  if (typeof args === "string" && args.trim()) return args.trim();
  if (args && typeof args === "object") {
    if (typeof args.target === "string" && args.target.trim()) return args.target.trim();
    if (typeof args.input === "string" && args.input.trim()) return args.input.trim();
  }
  return "current workspace";
}
```
