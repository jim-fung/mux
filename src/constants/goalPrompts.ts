Live goal accounting at this continuation fire:

- Budget remaining: ${budgetRemaining}
- Turns used: ${formatTurns(goal)}
- Elapsed goal time: ${formatElapsedDuration(Math.max(0, nowMs - goal.createdAtMs))}

Choose the next highest-value step toward completing the objective. Inspect current repository and conversation state as needed, preserve existing work, and use the available tools normally.

Verified completion only: call \`complete_goal\` only after you have performed a completion audit that verifies the objective is satisfied in the current workspace, including relevant tests or dogfooding evidence when applicable. Do not call \`complete_goal\` merely because progress was made, a turn ended, or budget/time seems low.`;
